React App

I though it would be fun to make a component that spreads some of
Ron Swanson's messages.

I make use of jamesseanwright's ron-swanson-quotes API.

Big thanks to him.

The app's theme is utilizing Blueprint UI.

Future expansions of this project will include other API's and perhaps
pictures of the people who have said the quotes.
